# Basic SilverStripe Calendar by Torindul

### Introduction

When working with our own clients we found that the majority of customers wanted an easy to use calendar within the site tree. Existing modules, whilst very strong, required the creation of pages to add events. Whilst okay on smaller sites it quickly became a mess on larger projects. torindul-silverstripe-calendar therefore makes makes use of custom DataObjects and GridField to achieve the same. Front end templates are given within the Module but are very limited by design to allow designers freedom over layouts.
